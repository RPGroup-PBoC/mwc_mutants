# Description :
# A titration run of the double mutants 'Q21M-F164T', 'Q21M-Q294K’, ’Q21M-Q294V' in
# ’in HG105 with an integrated 
# RBS1027 LacI (R=260) and an O2 operator. Performed overnights in replicate. 
# Run looked fine, though delta seemed a bit low. Note that this is labeled as r2 as second replicate of first run.
# Note that griffin prepared dilution in morning; Manuel started overnights the night before.
# Also note that the auto and delta files are duplicated from folder r1 since samples were run on the same plate.

# Description :
# A titration run of the inducer mutants Q294K, Q294V, F164T
# in HG105 with an integrated RBS1027 LacI (R=260) and an O2 operator.
# Note that it looks like Q294K will have to be remade - fluorescence is
# higher than delta! Also not responsive to IPTG.
# This mutant was not included in the final processing.

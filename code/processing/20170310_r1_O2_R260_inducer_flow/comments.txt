# Description :
# IPTG titration with all the O2+11 YFP DNA mutant strains
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# The plate was prepared and run by Griffin. These data correspond to the
# inducer binding mutants F164T, Q294K, and Q294V.  The flow rates were on the order of 3000 events per second. The run ran without any apparent issue.

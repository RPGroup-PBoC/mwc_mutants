# Description :
# LacI titration for the 3 DNA binding domain mutants plus the wild-type for the O2 operator.
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates 
# Comments :
# The following strains had super low flow rate and data is useless
# > R1220 Q21M
# > R1220 Y20I
# > R1220 WT

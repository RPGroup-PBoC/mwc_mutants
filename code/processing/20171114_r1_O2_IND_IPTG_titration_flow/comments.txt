# Description :
# A titration run of the inducer mutants  Q294K, F164T, and Q294V  and the WT
# coupled with an O2-regulated YFP. All repressors were expressed using the
# RBS1027 mutant yielding 260 repressors per cell.
# Comments:
# The flow rate on this experiment was very slow (~500 events per second)
# even though the OD was correct (~0.3).

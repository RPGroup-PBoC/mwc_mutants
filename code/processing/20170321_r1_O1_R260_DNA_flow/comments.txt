# User : sbarnes
# Description :
# IPTG titration with all the O1+11 YFP DNA mutant strains
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# The plate was prepared by sbarnes early in the morning and sbarnes performed the measurements in the
# flow cytometer. The flow run proceeded row by row rather than column by column.
# The flow rates were in the order of 10000 events / sec (may be high due to differences with equipment).
# The run seemed to proceed with no major delays.

# Description :
# A titration run of the DNA mutants Y20I, Q21A, Q21M, and the WT
# coupled with an O2-regulated YFP. All repressors were expressed using the
# RBS1027 mutant yielding 260 repressors per cell.
# Comments:
# The incorrect autofluorescence strain was inoculated overnight, meaning we
# had to use a HG105 strain without an mCherry plasmid that another person grew.
# Other than that, the flow rates were normal and went as planned.

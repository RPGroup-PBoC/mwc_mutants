# Description :
# A RBS titration experiment on the DNA mutants using the fluorescence microscope.
# All samples were grown for 8 hours without IPTG in a 96 2mL-deep well plate
# covered with a nylon cover. The cells were diluted and mounted on agarose
# pads and imaged in the normal fashion.
# Comments:
# Cells were kept for 2 hours in the cold room since the microscope schedule
# was changed The incubation chamber was already at37C therefore the entire
# session was taken at this temp. Most of the cells in the last 2 mutants Q21A
# and Q21M already divided therefore. I could not find cells for the Q21A R60
# sample. I remember hesitating when putting the samples, so it is very that the
# Y20I R60 sample is actually a mix of both populations since I might have put
# the drop in the same pad.

# Description :
# A titration run of the DNA mutant Q21M with all RBS modifications as well as
# a WT control with R=260.
# These were coupled with an O2-regulated YFP.
# Comments: The dilution was performed 1:5000 and allowed to grow for 10 hours
# rather than a 1:1000 and growth for 8 hours. The cultures were approximately
# at OD ~0.3 when the data was collected.

# Description :
# IPTG titration with all the O2+11 YFP DNA mutant strains 
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# The plate was prepared by me (Manuel) early in the morning and Stephanie added the cells to the plate at 11 am
# I performed the measurements and noted that for the first half of the plate the flow rate looked good, but for
# the second half it was much smaller. A possible explanation is that the equipment was not mixing cells before
# taking the sample, but I am not sure how big of an effect that would have.

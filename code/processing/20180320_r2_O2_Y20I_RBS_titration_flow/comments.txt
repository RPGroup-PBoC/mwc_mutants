# Description :
# A titration run of the DNA mutant Q21A with all RBS modifications as well as
# a WT control with R=260.
# These were coupled with an O2-regulated YFP.
# Comments:
# This dataset was rejected because the wrong autofluorescence strain was used
# which had CFP expressed from a plasmid. However, the mean autofluorescence
# from other datasets can be used for this calculation.

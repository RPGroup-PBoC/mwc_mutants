The figure below can be used to explore how changing the wild type values of  Ka and/or Ki by
different factors (θ or θ1/θ2), keeping all other parameters between the mutant and wild-type
the same, can result in non-monotonic behavior of ∆F. See the supplement
for a more detailed definition of the non-monotonic dependence. This figure was
generated using the [Bokeh interactive plotting
framework](http://bokeh.pydata.org) and the code used to generate it can be
accessed via [the code page]({{site.baseurl}}/code) of this website.

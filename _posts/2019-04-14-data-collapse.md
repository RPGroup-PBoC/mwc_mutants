Use the figure below to explore the data collapse of fold-change in gene
expression as a function of the free energy. Individual data sets can be shown
or hidden by clicking directly on the legend entries. Hover over each point to
get information about that point including the IPTG concentration, operator
identity, and number of repressors per cell. The code used to generate this
figure can be found on the [Code]({{site.baseurl}}/code) page.

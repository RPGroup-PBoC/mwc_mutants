# Description :
# A RBS titration experiment on the DNA mutants using the fluorescence microscope.
# All samples were grown for 8 hours without IPTG in a 96 2mL-deep well plate
# covered with a nylon cover. The cells were diluted and mounted on agarose
# pads and imaged in the normal fashion.
# Comments:
# The original files for Q21A R1220 were accidentally named as Y20I, and the
# Y20I R1220 samples were named Y20IREAL. These file names were corrected
# in post, but the metadata remains incorrect.

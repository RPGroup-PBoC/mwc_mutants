# Description :
# IPTG titration with the O2+11 YFP Q21A DNA mutant strains 
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# Note that I performed measurements on the Q21A lacI mutants (strains RBS1, RBS446, RBS1027, and RBS1147), as well as the wild-type RBS1027, delta LacI O2-yfp, and auto.
# flow cytometer. The flow rates were in the order of 2500 events / sec. The run seemed to proceed with no issue; aside from the first well (auto, 0 IPTG) where I injected 100 microliters which might have introduced some bubbles.

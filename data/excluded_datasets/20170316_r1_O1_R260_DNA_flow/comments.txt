# Description :
# IPTG titration with all the O1+11 YFP DNA mutant strains 
# The strains were grown in deep 96-well plates in 1 mL of LB + Kan + Spec and then
# diluted next morning 1:1000 into 0.5 mL of M9 + 0.5% glucose also in deep 96-well plates with the following
# IPTG concentrations:
# 0uM, 0.1uM, 5uM, 10uM, 25uM, 50uM, 75uM, 100uM, 250uM, 500uM, 1000uM, 5000uM
# Comments :
# Nathan prepared the plate, Nathan ran the flow cytometer and processed data.
# The flow rates were a bit high (6000-12000 counts per sec). 
# An error occurred during run where sampler stage - DeviceError: 0x0101: Position not allowed.
# This happened several times, requiring hardware to be re-initialized.

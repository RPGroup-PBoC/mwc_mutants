# Description :
# A titration run of the inducer mutants  Q294K, F164T, and Q294V  and the WT
# coupled with an O2-regulated YFP. All repressors were expressed using the
# RBS1027 mutant yielding 260 repressors per cell.
# Comments:
# Because the flow rate was very slow in previous runs, I performed a final
# dilution of 1:4 instead of the normal 1:10. This yielded flow rates around
# 3000 - 5000 events per second.

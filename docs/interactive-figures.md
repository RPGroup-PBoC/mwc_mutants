title: Interactive Figures
---

Though the model presented in the manuscript is composed of a small number of
biophysical parameters, the parameter space is still high dimensional, making
the presentation of how the parameters affect the free energy changes difficult
when restricted to static plots. To aid in rapid exploration of the parameter
space, we have made numerous figures interactive and have hosted them here. 

For performance reasons, we have given each interactive figure its own page,
which can be accessed here:

* [iFig 2: Sensitivity analysis of free energy to allosteric parameters]()
* [iFig 3: Free energy difference induced by DNA binding mutations]()
* [iFig 4: Free energy difference induced by inducer binding domain mutations]()
* [iFig 5: Prediction of double mutant induction profiles and free energy
  difference profiles]()
